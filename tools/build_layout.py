"""Regenerate the card's baked-in layout from the annotated record.

`docs/panel-layout.annotated.yaml` is the source: it carries every element box
on the plate together with the reasoning for the number. The card ships that
same geometry as the `PANEL_LAYOUT` constant, which is what this writes.

Edit the annotated file, run this, then run `tools/check_layout_sync.py`.
Never hand-edit PANEL_LAYOUT - the annotated file is where the "why" lives,
and an edit that skips it loses the only record of how a number was derived.

The `card_mod` block is dropped on the way through: the card sets its own
container and strips ha-card's chrome itself, so card-mod is not a dependency
any more.
