"""Draw the brand icon HACS and the Home Assistant brands repo ask for.

Original artwork, deliberately: the panel plate and every mark on it belong to
somebody else (see NOTICE), so the one image this repo can actually license is
one drawn from scratch. A seven-bar level meter is the honest subject - the
live meter is what the card is for.

Palette is the card's own: the bar gradient sampled off the artwork, and the
lime green the panel uses to mark the live selection, on the peak bar.

Transparent background, because the icon is shown on both light and dark
Home Assistant themes; the greys are kept in the top half of the plate's
gradient so they carry on either.

Writes custom_components/tide16/brand/icon.png (256) and icon@2x.png (512),
which are the sizes the brands repo requires.

Run:  python3 tools/make_brand_icon.py
