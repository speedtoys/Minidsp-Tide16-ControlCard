"""Prove the card's baked-in layout still matches the annotated record.

`docs/panel-layout.annotated.yaml` is where every element box on the plate is
explained - what it was anchored to on the artwork and why it is that number.
The card in `custom_components/tide16/frontend/tide16-panel.js` carries the
same boxes as data, and that copy is the one that ships.

Two copies of the same geometry is exactly the drift that has bitten this
repo before, so this is the check: the annotated file, minus the `card_mod`
block the card no longer needs, must equal `PANEL_LAYOUT` exactly.

Run it before every release:  python3 tools/check_layout_sync.py
