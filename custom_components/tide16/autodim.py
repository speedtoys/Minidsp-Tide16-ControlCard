"""Track the display's brightness to the sun.

The Tide16's front panel is bright enough to light a room, which is welcome in
daylight and not at all welcome once the lights are down and a film is on.
This walks the brightness between two levels across a window either side of
sunrise and sunset, using the sun at the Home Assistant location's own
coordinates - so it follows the season without anybody editing a schedule
twice a year.

It lives in the integration rather than in the card on purpose: the card runs
once per browser, so the same ramp would run several times over, and would not
run at all with no dashboard open. Here it runs once, headless, for as long as
Home Assistant does.

`set_brightness` is not in the endpoint list the unit's own control page
publishes - that page has no brightness control at all - and was found by
probing. `{"endpoint": "set_brightness", "value": 0-100}`; the unit answers
`{"status": "OK"}`, and rejects any other argument name with "Key value should
be present". A firmware without it will simply never dim, and the target
sensor is what says so.

Switching it off restores the day brightness; nothing else about the display
is touched, and in particular its sleep timeout is left alone - this is about
how bright the panel is, not how long it stays lit.

The ramp is linear across the window, and the rate therefore falls out of the
range and the window rather than being set directly: 80% to 20% across the
default 45 minutes is 1% every 45 seconds. Widen the window for a slower walk.
