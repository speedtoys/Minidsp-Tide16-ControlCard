"""The unit's multiple-choice controls: Dolby profile, upmixer, filter preset.

The Dolby profile is read from `get_settings` -> dolby.profile and written
with `set_dolby_profile`.  Both used to be a python script shelled out to by a
`command_line` sensor and a `shell_command`, because no integration spoke
either one.

`set_dolby_profile` is not in the endpoint list the unit's own control page
publishes - it was found by watching the device - so a firmware that does not
have it simply will not change, and the read-back is what tells us.
