"""The metering channel.

Sixteen channel levels, four times a second, is a live meter's worth of data
and a database's worth of trouble.  As entity state it needed a `recorder:`
exclusion in the user's own configuration.yaml, a service to raise the poll
rate, and a keepalive from the card to hold it there.

Here the card subscribes to a websocket command instead.  Frames go straight to
the subscribed connections, the fast cadence runs only while at least one
subscriber exists, and closing the tab is the unsubscribe - there is no state
anywhere that can get stuck fast, and nothing to keep out of the recorder.
